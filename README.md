# ICS372-TheaterFacade
Using the Facade design pattern for a theater management system.

# Purpose
This project was used to illustrate the "Facade" design patter, using the context of a theater management system as example. In this the Theater itself was a complicated system with more to it than a typical user would want or need to deal with. A user interface was created to simplify the interaction. Using the Theater's interface but providing only a subset of options that would pertain to a particular set of tasks.
